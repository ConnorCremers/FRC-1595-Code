I've found the best way to do this is to place the clone inside your eclipse workspace.
So if the path for your eclipse is /users/connor/documents/eclipse, your github would be /users/connor/documents/eclipse/FRC-1595-Code
You will have to create a project, delete it from workspace but not from disk, move it to github folder, and import it in eclipse.
Import any new projects that get created.
If there is a change in functionality, create a new projet with a new descriptive name.
Try to keep as many logic/math functions in separate .cpps. You have to create a header file, refer to simple drive code to see that.
Make sure to include omments because this is no longer for just yourself. Hopefully I'll do better than last year
